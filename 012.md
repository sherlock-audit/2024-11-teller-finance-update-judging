# Unsafe usage of approve method for some ERC20s

### Summary

The  "default" ERC20 behavior expects the `approve` function to return a boolean. however, some ERC20s on some chains don't return a value (The most popular example is USDT on the  Ethereum Mainnet).

### Root Cause

Since it is stated in readme that CHAINS and ERC20 tokens will be in use:

> Ethereum Mainnet, Polygon PoS, Arbitrum One, Base

> we already took special consideration to make sure USDT works with our contracts.

So for non-standard token such as USDT, calling approve will revert because the solmate ERC20 enforce the underlying token return a boolean.

### Internal pre-conditions

Standard ERC20s return a boolean on approval:

### External pre-conditions

USDT on the main net doesn't return a value:
https://etherscan.io/token/0xdac17f958d2ee523a2206206994597c13d831ec7#code

### Attack Path

DOS.

### Impact

`acceptFundsForAcceptBid` function will revert , if the principal token is USDT.
```solidity
principalToken.approve(address(TELLER_V2), _principalAmount);
```

### Mitigation

Use `forceApprove` instead of `approve`.
