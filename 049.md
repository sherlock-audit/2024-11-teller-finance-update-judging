# ERC-777 reentrancy will allow an attacker to permenantly cause some assets to be non-loanable in a LenderGroup

### Summary

ERC-777 reentrancy will allow an attacker to permenantly cause some assets to be non-loanable in a LenderGroup

### Root Cause

In the [readme the team has mentioned](https://github.com/sherlock-audit/2024-11-teller-finance-update/tree/main?tab=readme-ov-file#q-if-you-are-integrating-tokens-are-you-allowing-only-whitelisted-tokens-to-work-with-the-codebase-or-any-complying-with-the-standard-are-they-assumed-to-have-certain-properties-eg-be-non-reentrant-are-there-any-types-of-weird-tokens-you-want-to-integrate) that they would like to know if any wierd token breaks their contract pools. 

The `repaymentListener` is [set after the loan is accepted](https://github.com/sherlock-audit/2024-11-teller-finance-update/blob/0c8535728f97d37a4052d2a25909d28db886a422/teller-protocol-v2-audit-2024/packages/contracts/contracts/LenderCommitmentForwarder/extensions/LenderCommitmentGroup/LenderCommitmentGroup_Smart.sol#L581-L588)

```solidity
    function _acceptBidWithRepaymentListener(uint256 _bidId) internal {
        ITellerV2(TELLER_V2).lenderAcceptBid(_bidId); //this gives out the funds to the borrower

        // @audit repayment listener is set after the ERC777 token is transferred from the borrower
        ILoanRepaymentCallbacks(TELLER_V2).setRepaymentListenerForBid(
            _bidId,
            address(this)
        );
```

In case an ERC777 token is used as collateral/principal, the borrower can re-enter [during the token deposit](https://github.com/sherlock-audit/2024-11-teller-finance-update/blob/0c8535728f97d37a4052d2a25909d28db886a422/teller-protocol-v2-audit-2024/packages/contracts/contracts/CollateralManager.sol#L217)/token receival, and repay the loan

```solidity
    function deployAndDeposit(uint256 _bidId) external onlyTellerV2 {
        if (isBidCollateralBacked(_bidId)) {
            (address proxyAddress, ) = _deployEscrow(_bidId);
            _escrows[_bidId] = proxyAddress;


            for (
                uint256 i;
                i < _bidCollaterals[_bidId].collateralAddresses.length();
                i++
            ) {
                // @audit re-enter here and repay loan
                _deposit(
                    _bidId,
                    _bidCollaterals[_bidId].collateralInfo[
                        _bidCollaterals[_bidId].collateralAddresses.at(i)
                    ]
```

When a loan is repaid, the [repayLoanCallback](https://github.com/sherlock-audit/2024-11-teller-finance-update/blob/0c8535728f97d37a4052d2a25909d28db886a422/teller-protocol-v2-audit-2024/packages/contracts/contracts/LenderCommitmentForwarder/extensions/LenderCommitmentGroup/LenderCommitmentGroup_Smart.sol#L928-L936) function is supposed to be invoked in-order to increment the `totalPrincipalTokensRepaid` failure to do which will result in that much tokens forever being considered as `still lended`
```solidity
    function repayLoanCallback(
        uint256 _bidId,
        address repayer,
        uint256 principalAmount,
        uint256 interestAmount
    ) external onlyTellerV2 whenForwarderNotPaused whenNotPaused bidIsActiveForGroup(_bidId) { 
        totalPrincipalTokensRepaid += principalAmount;
        totalInterestCollected += interestAmount;
```

Since in this case repayment listener has not been setup, the `totalPrincipalTokensRepaid` won't be incremented. This will cause these tokens to forever be non-lendable

### Internal pre-conditions

1. ERC777 should be used as a collateral

### External pre-conditions

_No response_

### Attack Path

0. Pool is created with an ERC777 collateral and has 100 tokens balance
1. Attacker calls `acceptSmartCommitmentWithRecipient` in the SmartCommitmentForwarder with 100 as the bid amount
2. Attacker re-enters when transferring the token and invokes `repayLoanFullWithoutCollateralWithdraw`

Net result:
totalPrincipalTokensLended == 100
totalPrincipalTokensRepaid == 0

Even though 100 amount has been repaid, causing this amount to be forever non-lendable

### Impact

Attacker can cause assets of pool to be non-lendable

### PoC

_No response_

### Mitigation

Add nonReentrant modifier in repay functions and lenderAcceptBid function
