# Bids canceled or accepted are re-acceptable

### Summary

Once Bids are accepted, the state is changed from PENDING to others. Moreover if the borrower canceled the bid, the state is changed to CANCELED. But despite of this, these types of bids are re-acceptable. 

### Root Cause

In [`TellerV2.sol::lenderAcceptBid#L500`](https://github.com/sherlock-audit/2024-11-teller-finance-update/blob/main/teller-protocol-v2-audit-2024/packages/contracts/contracts/TellerV2.sol#L500), it checks to see if a pending loan has expired.
```solidity
function lenderAcceptBid(uint256 _bidId)
    external
    override
    pendingBid(_bidId, "lab")
    whenProtocolNotPaused
    returns (
        uint256 amountToProtocol,
        uint256 amountToMarketplace,
        uint256 amountToBorrower
    )
{
    ...
@>  require(!isLoanExpired(_bidId), "BE");
    ...
}
```
However, in `isLoanExpired()` function, it returns `false` if the `bid.state` is not equal to `BidState.PENDING` and if `bidExpirationTime[_bidId]` is equal to 0.[`TellerV2.sol::isLoanExpired#L1176-L1184`](https://github.com/sherlock-audit/2024-11-teller-finance-update/blob/main/teller-protocol-v2-audit-2024/packages/contracts/contracts/TellerV2.sol#L1176C5-L1184C6)
```solidity
    function isLoanExpired(uint256 _bidId) public view returns (bool) {
        Bid storage bid = bids[_bidId];

@>      if (bid.state != BidState.PENDING) return false;
@>      if (bidExpirationTime[_bidId] == 0) return false;

        return (uint32(block.timestamp) >
            bid.loanDetails.timestamp + bidExpirationTime[_bidId]);
    }
```
Following this function, if the state of Bids aren't `PENDING`,for example Bids were already canceled by borrower or already accepted once, it returns `false` and the require in `lenderAcceptBid()#L500` is passed. The case of `bidExpirationTime[_bidId] == 0` is also passed.  

### Internal pre-conditions

_No response_

### External pre-conditions

_No response_

### Attack Path

_No response_

### Impact

If the accepted bids are accepted again, previous lenders lost their assets and borrowers also lost their totalRepaid assets.

### PoC

_No response_

### Mitigation

Fix `isLoanExpired()` function by following:
```solidity
    function isLoanExpired(uint256 _bidId) public view returns (bool) {
        Bid storage bid = bids[_bidId];

@>      if (bid.state != BidState.PENDING) return true;
@>      if (bidExpirationTime[_bidId] == 0) return true;

        return (uint32(block.timestamp) >
            bid.loanDetails.timestamp + bidExpirationTime[_bidId]);
    }
```
