# Early repayers can be unexpectedly liquidated

### Summary

## Summary
`dueDate` calculations currently punish users who pay a cycle early as it does not extend their next due date
## Description
Let's observe how due dates are calculated in [`V2Calculations.sol`](https://github.com/sherlock-audit/2024-11-teller-finance-update/blob/0c8535728f97d37a4052d2a25909d28db886a422/teller-protocol-v2-audit-2024/packages/contracts/contracts/libraries/V2Calculations.sol#L179)
```solidity
         else if (_bidPaymentCycleType == PaymentCycleType.Seconds) {
        
            dueDate_ = _acceptedTimestamp + _paymentCycle;
         
            uint32 delta = _lastRepaidTimestamp - _acceptedTimestamp;
            if (delta > 0) {
                uint32 repaymentCycle = uint32(
                    Math.ceilDiv(delta, _paymentCycle)
                );
                dueDate_ += (repaymentCycle * _paymentCycle);
            }
        }
```
It starts by assigning `dueDate_` the value of the very first expected repayment and adds an extra `repaymentCycle` every time 1 `_paymentCycle` passes.

Issue is that `repaymentCycle` will return the same value for 2 cycle payments that took place within the same period e.g:
Assume 10 payment periods, each period is 10 seconds, entire loan duration is 100 seconds, accepted timestamp is 0
1. Payment with `_lastRepaidTimestamp = 6` will return `delta = 6, repaymentCycle = ceilDiv(6,10) = 1, dueDate_ = 20` 
2. Payment with `_lastRepaidTimestamp = 7` will return `delta = 7, repaymentCycle = ceilDiv(7,10) = 1, dueDate_ = 20`

Users who wish to repay earlier either for good reputation or to pay less interest in the future will be punished for doing so and could be unexpectedly liquidated since they know they have pre-paid their obligation for the subsequent cycle and still be marked as defaulted. A more illustrative example would be to pre-pay your April rent during February and still get evicted couple days into March for missing a payment. 

### Root Cause

- In `V2Calculations.calculateNextDueDate` does not extend the next due date based on the number of already paid cycles

### Internal pre-conditions

Borrower pre-pays their dues for a period further in the future (e.g paying April rent during February)

### External pre-conditions

None

### Attack Path

1. Borrower pays 2 periodic payments earlier in order to retain good reputation and pay interest on smaller principal in the future
2. Borrower does not initiate any payments for 1 full cycle 
3. Arbitrary party liquidates the borrower for missing a payment and seizes their collateral
4. Borrower is liquidated despite paying early

### Impact

Unfair liquidations and collateral seizure

### PoC

_No response_

### Mitigation

Track the total number of cycles paid and use it to calculate future due dates
