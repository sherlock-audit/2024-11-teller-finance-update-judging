# Lenders can't accept bids

### Summary

In the `submitBid`(with collateral) function of `TellerV2.sol`, approving process is missing.

https://github.com/sherlock-audit/2024-11-teller-finance-update/blob/main/teller-protocol-v2-audit-2024/packages/contracts/contracts/TellerV2.sol#L306-L335

This makes impossible for lenders to accept bids, because the following code will be reverted.

### Root Cause

In `TellerV2.sol:335`, there is a missing process to approve for `CollateralManager`.

### Impact

Lenders can't accept borrower's bids.

### Mitigation

Add approve process in `TellerV2.sol:335`.
