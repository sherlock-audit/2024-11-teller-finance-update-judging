# Failure to use updated payment amount will cause repayer's to loose assets in case they pay in excess

### Summary

Failure to use updated payment amount will cause re-payer's to loose assets in case they pay in excess

### Root Cause

In case the payment is greater than the owed amount, the `_sendOrEscrowFunds` function still uses the excess amount instead of the owed amount. This causes the excess amounts to be lost to the borrower

    function _repayLoan(

        bool _shouldWithdrawCollateral
    ) internal virtual {
        Bid storage bid = bids[_bidId];
        uint256 paymentAmount = _payment.principal + _payment.interest;


        RepMark mark = reputationManager.updateAccountReputation(
            bid.borrower,
            _bidId
        );


        // Check if we are sending a payment or amount remaining
        if (paymentAmount >= _owedAmount) {
            paymentAmount = _owedAmount;

        ...

        // @audit the old _payment amount is still used instead of the updated paymentAmount
        _sendOrEscrowFunds(_bidId, _payment); //send or escrow the funds
