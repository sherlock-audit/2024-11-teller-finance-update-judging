# Users' prepared shares never expire

### Summary

Users in the smart commitment group can circumvent the time lock imposed for withdrawing assets.

### Root Cause

When users want to withdraw assets from the smart commitment group, they are first required to [prepare them for burning](https://github.com/sherlock-audit/2024-11-teller-finance-update/blob/0c8535728f97d37a4052d2a25909d28db886a422/teller-protocol-v2-audit-2024/packages/contracts/contracts/LenderCommitmentForwarder/extensions/LenderCommitmentGroup/LenderCommitmentGroup_Smart.sol#L593-L599).

### Internal pre-conditions

1. User must already own shares in the group

### External pre-conditions

None

### Attack Path

None

### Impact

A user can invest in the group with a large capital, then as soon as they receive their shares, prepare all of them for burning. This allows them to later circumvent the time lock and [redeem the assets instantly](https://github.com/sherlock-audit/2024-11-teller-finance-update/blob/0c8535728f97d37a4052d2a25909d28db886a422/teller-protocol-v2-audit-2024/packages/contracts/contracts/LenderCommitmentForwarder/extensions/LenderCommitmentGroup/LenderCommitmentGroup_Smart.sol#L612-L646).

There is no expiration in place when preparing shares for burning which allows this. The user which has prepared their shares for burning in advance will be able to withdraw their assets instantly in case of emergency or unexpected market conditions while other users will have to wait out the time lock which can be as long as 24h.

### PoC

_No response_

### Mitigation

If the preparation isn't redeemed in `t` amount of time, require a new one to be made.
