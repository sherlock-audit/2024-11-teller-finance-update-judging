# The `totalPrincipalTokensRepaid` and `totalInterestCollected` may not be updated even when funds are already transferred

### Summary
The `LenderCommitmentGroup_Smart.repayLoanCallback()` function will be paused, causing the transaction to continue despite the revert. As a result, while the funds are transferred, the amounts will not be added to `totalPrincipalTokensRepaid` and `totalInterestCollected`. This discrepancy will lead to an incorrect calculation of the exchange rate, potentially resulting in a loss of funds for shareholders.

### Root Cause

The `LenderCommitmentGroup_Smart.repayLoanCallback()` function will revert due to being paused.

```solidity
    function repayLoanCallback(
        uint256 _bidId,
        address repayer,
        uint256 principalAmount,
        uint256 interestAmount
@>  ) external onlyTellerV2 whenForwarderNotPaused whenNotPaused bidIsActiveForGroup(_bidId) { 
        totalPrincipalTokensRepaid += principalAmount;
        totalInterestCollected += interestAmount;

         emit LoanRepaid(
            _bidId,
            repayer,
            principalAmount,
            interestAmount,
            totalPrincipalTokensRepaid,
            totalInterestCollected
        );
    }
```

However, the whole transaction will not be reverted because of the try/catch statement.

```solidity
        if (loanRepaymentListener != address(0)) {
            require(gasleft() >= 80000, "NR gas");  //fixes the 63/64 remaining issue
@>          try
                ILoanRepaymentListener(loanRepaymentListener).repayLoanCallback{
                    gas: 80000
                }( //limit gas costs to prevent lender preventing repayments
                    _bidId,
                    _msgSenderForMarket(bid.marketplaceId),
                    _payment.principal,
                    _payment.interest
                )
@>          {} catch {}
        }
```

Borrowers can repay their loans even during a pause. This means that while the funds are transferred, the amounts will not be added to `totalPrincipalTokensRepaid` and `totalInterestCollected`. Consequently, the exchange rate will be calculated incorrectly, which could result in a loss of funds for shareholders.
