# Not updating state before making custom external call can cause borrower's to loose assets due to re-entrancy

### Summary

Not updating state before making custom external call can cause borrower's to loose assets due to re-entrancy

### Root Cause

The details of the repayment is updated only after the external call to the `loanRepaymentListener` is made

```solidity
    function _repayLoan(
        uint256 _bidId,
        Payment memory _payment,
        uint256 _owedAmount,
        bool _shouldWithdrawCollateral
    ) internal virtual {
        
        ....
        // @audit attacker can re-enter here. the repayment details are not yet updated
        _sendOrEscrowFunds(_bidId, _payment); //send or escrow the funds

        // update our mappings
        bid.loanDetails.totalRepaid.principal += _payment.principal;
        bid.loanDetails.totalRepaid.interest += _payment.interest;
        bid.loanDetails.lastRepaidTimestamp = uint32(block.timestamp);
```

```solidity
    function _sendOrEscrowFunds(uint256 _bidId, Payment memory _payment)
        internal virtual 
    {
        
        ....

        address loanRepaymentListener = repaymentListenerForBid[_bidId];

        // @audit re-enter in this call
        if (loanRepaymentListener != address(0)) {
            require(gasleft() >= 80000, "NR gas");  //fixes the 63/64 remaining issue
            try
                ILoanRepaymentListener(loanRepaymentListener).repayLoanCallback{
                    gas: 80000
                }( //limit gas costs to prevent lender preventing repayments
                    _bidId,
                    _msgSenderForMarket(bid.marketplaceId),
                    _payment.principal,
                    _payment.interest
                )
            {} catch {}
```

This allows a malicious lender to reenter the `TellerV2` contract and invoke `lenderCloseLoan` seizing the collateral of the borrower as well if the loan is currently defaulted

### Internal pre-conditions

1. The repayment should be made after defaultTimestamp has passed

### External pre-conditions

_No response_

### Attack Path

1. Defaulting timestmap of loan has passed
2. Borrower does a repayment of 100 which is transferred to the lender. Following this `.repayLoanCallback` is called
3. Lender reenters via the `loanRepaymentListener` and invokes the `lenderCloseLoan` function further seizing the collateral of the borrower
4. Borrower looses both the repayment amount and the collateral

### Impact

Borrower will loose repayment amount and also the collateral

### PoC

_No response_

### Mitigation

Update the state before the `loanRepaymentListener` call is made
