# Lender group members can be prevented from burning their shares forever

### Summary

## Summary
Adversaries can constantly reset the withdrawal delay of lender group members by performing 0-value `transferFrom` transactions to invoke the `afterTokenTransfer` hook.
## Description
Currently there is a delay on withdrawals to prevent sandwich attacks in lender group contracts. Members must invoke `prepareSharesForBurn` by stating how many shares they want to burn and start an internal countdown. Afterwards, members invoke `burnSharesToWithdrawEarnings` which checks whether the delay passed in `burn`
```solidity
    function burn(address _burner, uint256 _amount, uint256 withdrawDelayTimeSeconds) external onlyOwner {

        //require prepared 
        require(poolSharesPreparedToWithdrawForLender[_burner] >= _amount,"Shares not prepared for withdraw");
   @>   require(poolSharesPreparedTimestamp[_burner] <= block.timestamp - withdrawDelayTimeSeconds,"Shares not prepared for withdraw");
        

        //reset prepared   
        poolSharesPreparedToWithdrawForLender[_burner] = 0;
        poolSharesPreparedTimestamp[_burner] =  block.timestamp;
  


        _burn(_burner, _amount);
    }
```


This countdown is reset every time a member invokes a share transfer through the `_afterTokenTransfer` hook presumably to prevent users preparing shares in advance by transferring it between one another.
```solidity
     function _afterTokenTransfer(
        address from,
        address to,
        uint256 amount
    ) internal override {

         //reset prepared   
        poolSharesPreparedToWithdrawForLender[from] = 0;
        poolSharesPreparedTimestamp[from] =  block.timestamp;


    }
```
Adversaries can perform 0-value `transferFrom` transactions which will always pass as there are no 0-value checks in OZ's version 4.8 `ERC20.sol` used by the protocol. Users will have their countdown constantly reset thus being prevented from withdrawing forever or until a bribe is paid. 

### Root Cause

- OpenZeppelin's `ERC20.transferFrom` has no 0-value input validation
- `LenderCommitmentGroupShares._afterTokenTransfer` does not perform 0-value input either.

### Internal pre-conditions

Group members must have invoked `prepareSharesForBurn`

### External pre-conditions

None

### Attack Path

1. Group member invokes `prepareSharesForBurn` starting the countdown
2. Adversary invokes `transferFrom(victim, to, 0)` minutes before the cooldown expires
3. Cooldown and shares are reset because `_afterTokenTransfer` was triggered
4. Group member is forced to re-prepare their shares
5. Attacker repeats this continuously or until a bribe is paid

### Impact

Lender commit group members will have their funds permanently locked in the contract

### PoC

_No response_

### Mitigation

Rewrite the [`_afterTokenTransfer`](https://github.com/sherlock-audit/2024-11-teller-finance-update/blob/0c8535728f97d37a4052d2a25909d28db886a422/teller-protocol-v2-audit-2024/packages/contracts/contracts/LenderCommitmentForwarder/extensions/LenderCommitmentGroup/LenderCommitmentGroupShares.sol#L60) hook to be skipped in case of `amount = 0`
