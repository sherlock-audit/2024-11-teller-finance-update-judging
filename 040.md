# Loan repayment can be intentionally done with slightly less than 80k gas

### Summary

Incorrect check will cause the `loanRepaymentListener` to receive less than 80k gas limit

### Root Cause

The [check performed](https://github.com/sherlock-audit/2024-11-teller-finance-update/blob/0c8535728f97d37a4052d2a25909d28db886a422/teller-protocol-v2-audit-2024/packages/contracts/contracts/TellerV2.sol#L938-L945) before making the call to `loanRepaymentListener` is that there is atleast 80k gasleft 

```solidity
        if (loanRepaymentListener != address(0)) {
            require(gasleft() >= 80000, "NR gas");  //fixes the 63/64 remaining issue
            try
                ILoanRepaymentListener(loanRepaymentListener).repayLoanCallback{
                    gas: 80000
                }( //limit gas costs to prevent lender preventing repayments
                    _bidId,
                    _msgSenderForMarket(bid.marketplaceId),
```

But this will fail to send 80k gas to the `loanRepaymentListener` due to the 63/64 rule ie. if 81250 gas is present, then only (81250 * 63/64 == 79980) gas will be sent. If the `loanRepaymentListener` expects exactly 80k gas for its execution, it will cause its execution to revert

### Internal pre-conditions

`loanRepaymentListener` should need very close to 80k gas for its execution

### External pre-conditions

_No response_

### Attack Path

1. The loan is repaid with a gas amount such that the gas sent to `loanRepaymentListener` is less than 80k 

### Impact

Attacker can intentionally make the execution of `loanRepaymentListener` revert

### PoC

_No response_

### Mitigation

Keep a buffer and not the exact amount so that there is exactly 80k gas to be sent to the `loanRepaymentListener`
