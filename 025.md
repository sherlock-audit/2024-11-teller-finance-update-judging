# Market owners can still front-run users to increase fees

### Summary

Issue [#125](https://github.com/sherlock-audit/2024-04-teller-finance-judging/issues/125)'s fix from the previous Sherlock audit still allows market owners to front-run users and increase fees.

### Root Cause

In `TellerV2.sol`, users [submitting a bid can still be front-ran](https://github.com/sherlock-audit/2024-11-teller-finance-update/blob/0c8535728f97d37a4052d2a25909d28db886a422/teller-protocol-v2-audit-2024/packages/contracts/contracts/TellerV2.sol#L517-L519) by the market owner, increasing the fee and forcing them to pay a higher fee amount.

### Internal pre-conditions

None

### External pre-conditions

None

### Attack Path

1. User submits bid
2. Market owner front-runs the user's tx with call to [`setMarketFeePercent`](https://github.com/sherlock-audit/2024-11-teller-finance-update/blob/0c8535728f97d37a4052d2a25909d28db886a422/teller-protocol-v2-audit-2024/packages/contracts/contracts/MarketRegistry.sol#L637-L653)
3. User gets charged higher fee

### Impact

The issue is that the fix from the previous audit simply limited the market owners to a max fee percentage of 10%. This still allows the front-running issue to happen. For example the market fee is 1%, but the owner front runs the user's call to submit bid and increases it to 10%, the user now pays 10x more in fees.

Thus, the "fix" of the previous issue doesn't remedy users from still experiencing the loss due to a fee increase, it's just now limited to 10x instead of 100x.

### PoC

_No response_

### Mitigation

An option would be a timelock. When a market owner increases/decreases the fee, don't apply the changes until 24h later or something similar.
