# Incompatibility of FullMath Library with Solidity's Overflow Protection

### Summary

The `FullMath` library, adapted for Teller's protocol from Uniswap V3, fails to handle overflows correctly under Solidity ≥0.8.0. This causes execution to revert during critical calculations when intermediate values exceed the 256-bit limit, disrupting the intended functionality of the library.


### Root Cause

The original `FullMath` library in UniswapV3 was designed for Solidity <0.8.0, where overflows were not automatically checked.

But in Teller protocol, the `FullMath` library has been adapted from Uniswap V3 for use with Solidity ≥0.8.0.

With Solidity ≥0.8.0, overflow checks are enforced, causing reversion in calculations that rely on the "phantom overflow" behavior of the original library. 

This effectively means that when a phantom overflow (a multiplication and division where an intermediate value overflows 256 bits) occurs the execution will revert and the correct result won't be returned.
