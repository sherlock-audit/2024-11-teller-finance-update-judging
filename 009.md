# Missing OpenZeppelin Upgradeable Initializations will Impact Protocol Security and Functionality

### Summary

Multiple contracts failing to initialize inherited OpenZeppelin upgradeable contracts will cause a systemic issue for protocol users as uninitialized contracts may operate with improper state variables and access controls.

### Root Cause

In the following contracts, there are missing initializations of inherited OpenZeppelin upgradeable contracts:

https://github.com/sherlock-audit/2024-11-teller-finance-update/blob/main/teller-protocol-v2-audit-2024/packages/contracts/contracts/TellerV2.sol#L49-L52

https://github.com/sherlock-audit/2024-11-teller-finance-update/blob/main/teller-protocol-v2-audit-2024/packages/contracts/contracts/LenderCommitmentForwarder/SmartCommitmentForwarder.sol#L51-L55



1. In `LenderCommitmentGroup_Smart.sol`, the contract inherits ReentrancyGuardUpgradeable but fails to call `__ReentrancyGuard_init()`
2. In `TellerV2.sol`, the contract inherits OwnableUpgradeable but fails to call `__Ownable_init()`
3. In `SmartCommitmentForwarder.sol`, the contract inherits ReentrancyGuardUpgradeable but fails to call `__ReentrancyGuard_init()`


### Internal pre-conditions

1. Contracts must be deployed and initialized through their respective proxy patterns
2. For LenderCommitmentGroup_Smart and SmartCommitmentForwarder, reentrancy protection would need to be required for a function execution
3. For TellerV2, ownership functionality would need to be invoked

### External pre-conditions

No external pre-conditions required as this is an implementation issue.

### Attack Path

For TellerV2:
1. Contract is deployed and initialized without proper `__Ownable_init()`
2. Initial owner state may be improperly set
3. Ownership functions could behave unexpectedly or fail
4. Critical owner-only functions may become inaccessible or improperly secured

For LenderCommitmentGroup_Smart and SmartCommitmentForwarder:
1. Contracts are deployed without proper `__ReentrancyGuard_init()`
2. Reentrancy guard state variables are not properly initialized
3. nonReentrant modifier may not provide expected protection
4. Potential for reentrancy attacks on protected functions

### Impact

The affected parties (protocol and users) face multiple risks:

1. LenderCommitmentGroup_Smart:
- Missing reentrancy protection could allow unauthorized reentrant calls
- Critical functions marked with nonReentrant may be vulnerable
- Potential loss of funds through reentrancy attacks

2. TellerV2:
- Ownership functionality may be compromised
- Administrative functions could become inaccessible
- Security of owner-protected functions may be compromised

3. SmartCommitmentForwarder:
- Similar to LenderCommitmentGroup_Smart, reentrancy attacks possible
- Protected functions may be vulnerable to exploitation
- Potential loss of funds or unauthorized operations

The overall protocol security could be significantly compromised, potentially leading to unauthorized access, fund loss, or contract functionality failure.

### PoC

_No response_

### Mitigation

1. Add proper initialization calls in the affected contracts' `initialize()` functions:

```solidity
// LenderCommitmentGroup_Smart.sol
function initialize(...) initializer {
    __ReentrancyGuard_init();
    // Rest of initialization logic
}

// TellerV2.sol
function initialize(...) initializer {
    __Ownable_init();
    // Rest of initialization logic
}

// SmartCommitmentForwarder.sol
function initialize(...) initializer {
    __ReentrancyGuard_init();
    // Rest of initialization logic
}
```

2. Ensure the `initializer` modifier is used to prevent multiple initializations
