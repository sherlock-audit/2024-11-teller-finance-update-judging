# Anyone can remove lender and borrowers from MarketRegistry

### Summary

In the current implementation of the `MarketRegistry` contract, any actor can revoke a lender or borrower for markets that require lender or borrower attestation.

### Root Cause

The contract defines two versions of the `revokeLender` function:  

1. **Function `revokeLender(uint256 _marketId, address _lenderAddress, uint8 _v, bytes32 _r, bytes32 _s)`**  
   This function internally calls `_revokeStakeholderViaDelegation` but does not verify the signature (`v, r, s`) against the market owner, nor does it enforce any other ownership or permission checks. This omission allows unauthorized users to revoke stakeholders.
   
   Example code from `_revokeStakeholderViaDelegation`:
   ```solidity
   function _revokeStakeholderViaDelegation(
           uint256 _marketId,
           address _stakeholderAddress,
           bool _isLender,
           uint8 _v,
           bytes32 _r,
           bytes32 _s
       ) internal {
           bytes32 uuid = _revokeStakeholderVerification(
               _marketId,
               _stakeholderAddress,
               _isLender
           );
           // Note: Call to revoke attestation on EAS contracts is disabled.
       }
   ```

2. **Function `revokeLender(uint256 _marketId, address _lenderAddress)`**  
   This version includes a check to ensure the caller is the market owner.

The discrepancy between these two versions creates an exploitable vulnerability.

### Internal pre-conditions

### External pre-conditions

_No response_

### Attack Path

_No response_

### Impact

Unauthorized revocation of lenders or borrowers can disrupt the proper functioning of markets that rely on stakeholder attestations. This could lead to:

- Denial of service for legitimate lenders and borrowers.
- Loss of trust in the platform.
- Potential financial losses for affected parties.

### PoC

This vulnerability can be exploited by crafting a transaction to call revokeLender or revokeBorrower with arbitrary v, r, s values.

```solidity
revokeLender(marketId, victimAddress, randomV, randomR, randomS);
```

This call bypasses ownership and attestation verification, removing the specified lender.

### Mitigation

**Add Verification** : Update the revokeLender and revokeBorrower functions that accept v, r, s to enforce attestation verification against the market owner's signature
