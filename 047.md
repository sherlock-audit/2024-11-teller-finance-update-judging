# Attacker can DOS the `by delegation methods` of the market registry contract by directly passing the signature to Verifier contract

### Summary

Attacker can DOS the `by delegation methods` of the market registry contract by directly passing the signature to Verifier contract

### Root Cause

The `MarketRegistry` contract exposes attestaion/revocation [methods based on delegation ie. signatures](https://github.com/sherlock-audit/2024-11-teller-finance-update/blob/0c8535728f97d37a4052d2a25909d28db886a422/teller-protocol-v2-audit-2024/packages/contracts/contracts/MarketRegistry.sol#L1078-L1087). These signatures are then passed on to the `TellerASEIP712Verifier` contract for verification

```solidity
    function _attestStakeholderViaDelegation(
        uint256 _marketId,
        address _stakeholderAddress,
        uint256 _expirationTime,
        bool _isLender,
        uint8 _v,
        bytes32 _r,
        bytes32 _s
    )
        internal
```

But the [Verifier contract allows anybody to call it and increments the nonce if a valid signature is passed](https://github.com/sherlock-audit/2024-11-teller-finance-update/blob/0c8535728f97d37a4052d2a25909d28db886a422/teller-protocol-v2-audit-2024/packages/contracts/contracts/EAS/TellerASEIP712Verifier.sol#L68-L100). This allows a user to pass the delegation signature directly to the verifier contract which will increment the nonce of the signer hence reverting when the actual call from the MarketRegistry happens
```solidity
    function attest(
        address recipient,
        bytes32 schema,
        uint256 expirationTime,
        bytes32 refUUID,
        bytes calldata data,
        address attester,
        uint8 v,
        bytes32 r,
        bytes32 s
    ) external override {
        bytes32 digest = keccak256(
            abi.encodePacked(
                "\x19\x01",
                DOMAIN_SEPARATOR,
                keccak256(
                    abi.encode(
                        ATTEST_TYPEHASH,
                        recipient,
                        schema,
                        expirationTime,
                        refUUID,
                        keccak256(data),
                        _nonces[attester]++
                    )
                )
            )
        );

        address recoveredAddress = ecrecover(digest, v, r, s);
        if (recoveredAddress == address(0) || recoveredAddress != attester) {
            revert InvalidSignature();
        }
```

### Internal pre-conditions

_No response_

### External pre-conditions

_No response_

### Attack Path

1. MarketRegistry admin decides to attest a user by delegation
2. Attacker frontruns this tx and submits the signature to the Verifier contract direclty
3. The call from MarketRegistry reverts because the nonce has already been increased and the signature wouldn't match

### Impact

Attacker can DOS the byDelegation methods of attestation and revocation (currently revoking doesn't pass on the call to TellerAS contract but ideally it would)

### PoC

_No response_

### Mitigation

Maintain an internal verification mechanism rather than doing it in an external contract or enforce access control
