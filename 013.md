# Bid Submission Vulnerable to Changes in Market Parameters

### Summary

_No response_

### Root Cause

In [_submitBid()](https://github.com/sherlock-audit/2024-11-teller-finance-update/blob/main/teller-protocol-v2-audit-2024/packages/contracts/contracts/TellerV2.sol#L337), certain bid parameters are taken from the `marketRegistry`:

```solidity
  function _submitBid(...)
        ...
        (bid.terms.paymentCycle, bidPaymentCycleType[bidId]) = marketRegistry
            .getPaymentCycle(_marketplaceId);

        bid.terms.APR = _APR;

        bidDefaultDuration[bidId] = marketRegistry.getPaymentDefaultDuration(
            _marketplaceId
        );

        bidExpirationTime[bidId] = marketRegistry.getBidExpirationTime(
            _marketplaceId
        );

        bid.paymentType = marketRegistry.getPaymentType(_marketplaceId);
        
        bid.terms.paymentCycleAmount = V2Calculations
            .calculatePaymentCycleAmount(
                bid.paymentType,
                bidPaymentCycleType[bidId],
                _principal,
                _duration,
                bid.terms.paymentCycle,
                _APR
            );
        ...
```

All the parameters taken from `marketRegistry` are controlled by the market owner:

### Impact

If market parameters are changed in between the borrower submitting a bid transaction and the transaction being applied, borrower may be subject to changes in `bidDefaultDuration`, `bidExpirationTime`, `paymentType`, `paymentCycle`, `bidPaymentCycleType` and `paymentCycleAmount`.

That is, the user may be committed to the bid for longer / shorter than expected. They may have a longer / shorter default duration (time for the loan being considered defaulted / eligible for liquidation). They have un-provisioned for payment type and cycle parameters.

I believe most of this will have a medium impact on borrower (mild inconveniences / resolvable by directly repaying the loan) if the market owner is not evil and adapting the parameters reasonably.

An evil market owner can set the value of `bidDefaultDuration` and `paymentCycle` very low (0) so that the loan will default immediately. It can then accept the bid, make user default immediately, and liquidate the loan to steal the user's collateral. This results in a loss of collateral for the borrower.


### PoC

### Mitigation

Take every single parameters as input of `_submitBid()` (including fee percents) and compare them to the values in `marketRegistry` to make sure borrower agrees with them, revert if they differ.
