# marketForwarder for a specific market can spoof a user all markets

### Summary

Marketforwarder is shared across all markets for a user instead of just the intended market

### Root Cause

The `approveMarketForwarder` is supposed to approve a forwarder contract [for a specific market](https://github.com/sherlock-audit/2024-11-teller-finance-update/blob/0c8535728f97d37a4052d2a25909d28db886a422/teller-protocol-v2-audit-2024/packages/contracts/contracts/TellerV2Context.sol#L87-L100).

```solidity
     * @notice Approves a forwarder contract to use their address as a sender for a specific market.
     * @notice The forwarder given must be trusted by the market given.
     * @param _marketId An ID for a lending market.
     * @param _forwarder A forwarder contract address.
     */
    function approveMarketForwarder(uint256 _marketId, address _forwarder)
        external
    {
        require(
            isTrustedMarketForwarder(_marketId, _forwarder),
            "Forwarder must be trusted by the market"
        );
        _approvedForwarderSenders[_forwarder].add(_msgSender());
        emit MarketForwarderApproved(_marketId, _forwarder, _msgSender());
```

But this is not followed. If a user approves a forwarder for one market, that [forwarder can spoof the user for any other market in which they are considered trusted](https://github.com/sherlock-audit/2024-11-teller-finance-update/blob/0c8535728f97d37a4052d2a25909d28db886a422/teller-protocol-v2-audit-2024/packages/contracts/contracts/TellerV2Context.sol#L122-L140)

```solidity
    function _msgSenderForMarket(uint256 _marketId)
        internal
        view
        virtual
        returns (address)
    {
        if (
            msg.data.length >= 20 &&
            isTrustedMarketForwarder(_marketId, _msgSender())
        ) {
            address sender;
            assembly {
                sender := shr(96, calldataload(sub(calldatasize(), 20)))
            }
            // Ensure the appended sender address approved the forwarder
            // @audit no market wise seperation
            require(
=>              _approvedForwarderSenders[_msgSender()].contains(sender),
                "Sender must approve market forwarder"
            );
```

### Internal pre-conditions

_No response_

### External pre-conditions

_No response_

### Attack Path

1. User approves A as a trusted forwarder for MA
2. A is also made the trusted forwarder of MB and MC by the respective owners
3. A can now spoof the user for MB and MC also which they have not intended

### Impact

The trusted forwarder for a market can spoof the user across all markets. This can result in bids and lendings for terms that the user doesn't align with

### PoC

_No response_

### Mitigation

Seperate forwarders marketwise
