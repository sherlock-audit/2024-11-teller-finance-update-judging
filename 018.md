# Off-by-One Error in _getStakeholdersForMarket Leads to Potential Memory Out-of-Bounds Access

### Summary

The function _getStakeholdersForMarket in the MarketRegistry.sol contains an off-by-one error when populating the stakeholders_ array. Specifically, the loop variable i is directly used to index into the array, which causes memory misalignment since the array's indices start from 0. This bug can result in out-of-bounds memory writes, corrupted data, or runtime exceptions.

### Root Cause

https://github.com/sherlock-audit/2024-11-teller-finance-update/blob/main/teller-protocol-v2-audit-2024/packages/contracts/contracts/MarketRegistry.sol#L1002

```Solidity
uint256 len = _set.length();

uint256 start = _page * _perPage;
if (start <= len) {
    uint256 end = start + _perPage;
    // Ensure we do not go out of bounds
    if (end > len) {
        end = len;
    }

    stakeholders_ = new address[](end - start);
    for (uint256 i = start; i < end; i++) {
        stakeholders_[i] = _set.at(i);
    }
}
```

The incorrect indexing logic in the loop:

stakeholders_[i] = _set.at(i);
The loop iterates over the range [start, end) in _set, but directly uses i as the index for stakeholders_ without adjusting for the array's base index (0).

### Internal pre-conditions

_No response_

### External pre-conditions

_No response_

### Attack Path

_No response_

### Impact

Incorrect memory access may lead to:
- Reverts: If accessing an index out of bounds in stakeholders_.
- Corrupted Data: Assigning incorrect values or overwriting unintended memory locations.
- Gas Wastage: Due to failed transactions and repeated calls.


### PoC

_No response_

### Mitigation

Adjust the indexing logic in the loop to account for the zero-based indexing of stakeholders_. Replace:
stakeholders_[i] = _set.at(i);
With:
stakeholders_[i - start] = _set.at(i);

Corrected Code:

```Solidity
function _getStakeholdersForMarket(
    EnumerableSet.AddressSet storage _set,
    uint256 _page,
    uint256 _perPage
) internal view returns (address[] memory stakeholders_) {
    uint256 len = _set.length();

    uint256 start = _page * _perPage;
    if (start >= len) {
        return new address  }

    uint256 end = start + _perPage;
    if (end > len) {
        end = len;
    }

    stakeholders_ = new address[](end - start);
    for (uint256 i = start; i < end; i++) {
        stakeholders_[i - start] = _set.at(i); // Correct index adjustment
    }
}
