# Incorrect Handling of Desired Overflow in `FullMath` Library with Solidity ≥0.8

## Summary

The `FullMath` library, originally designed for Solidity `<0.8.0` in `Uniswap V3`, has been modified to work with Solidity `>=0.8.0` in the Teller protocol. However, this modification does not handle the library's reliance on "phantom overflow" effectively. As a result, the library fails when intermediate calculations exceed the 256-bit limit, causing execution to revert.

## Vulnerability Details

The Uniswap V3's [FullMath.sol](https://github.com/Uniswap/v3-core/blob/main/contracts/libraries/FullMath.sol) library was originally designed to allow intermediate overflows during multiplication and division operations, referred to as "phantom overflow." The library was designed for Solidity `<0.8.0`, relying on the absence of built-in overflow checks.

However, the version of the [FullMath.sol](https://github.com/sherlock-audit/2024-11-teller-finance-update/blob/0c8535728f97d37a4052d2a25909d28db886a422/teller-protocol-v2-audit-2024/packages/contracts/contracts/libraries/uniswap/FullMath.sol#L2) library ported to Teller protocol has been compiled with Solidity `>=0.8.0`, which introduces built-in overflow/underflow protection. 

The library is used in Teller’s `UniswapPricingLibrary.sol` and plays a critical role in price calculations. Since Solidity `>=0.8.0` automatically reverts on arithmetic overflow, the affected operations within the `FullMath` library fail when intermediate values exceed 256 bits.

As a result, multiplication and division operations that rely on the expected intermediate overflows now revert, breaking the intended functionality of the library.


Although `FullMath` itself is an out-of-scope library, its use in an in-scope contract (`UniswapPricingLibrary.sol`) makes this issue valid under the following **Sherlock** rule:
> "In case the vulnerability exists in a library and an in-scope contract uses it and is affected by this bug, this is a valid issue."

## Impact
The correct result isn't returned in this case and the execution gets reverted when a phantom overflows occurs.

## Recommendation
The affected `FullMath` library should be updated to the latest version that explicitly handles overflows using `unchecked` blocks.
 Modified version of FullMath designed for Solidity `>=0.8.0` is available in the [Uniswap v3-core repository (0.8 branch)](https://github.com/Uniswap/v3-core/blob/0.8/contracts/libraries/FullMath.sol).
