# Marketplace fees are not bound to bid at submission time, which might cause unexpected fees

### Summary

Marketplace fees are only taken into account for a bid when a lender calls [lenderAcceptBid](https://github.com/sherlock-audit/2024-11-teller-finance-update/blob/0c8535728f97d37a4052d2a25909d28db886a422/teller-protocol-v2-audit-2024/packages/contracts/contracts/TellerV2.sol#L473), which allows the marketplace owner to freely modify the marketplace fee before the bid is actually accepted by the lender.

### Root Cause

The fee for the bid is fetched from the marketplaceâ€™s details in lenderAcceptBid. In the time interval between a user submits the bid and a lender accepts the bid, the marketplace owner can change the fee without notifying the user. This can be used as a honeypot where one creates a marketplace with very low fees, waits for users to submit bids, changes the fee to a very high percent and accepts the bids, causing users to pay more than they think.

### Internal pre-conditions

1. Attacker needs to create a marketplace
2. Victim needs to create a bid

### External pre-conditions

_No response_

### Attack Path

1. [Attacker] Creates a marketplace with a low fee
2. [Victim] Submits a bid
3. [Attacker] Changes the marketplace fee to a higher amount
4. [Attacker] Accepts the bid (either from their own contract or a new one added to the list of verified lenders)
5. [Victim] Has a bid with a higher fee than expected

### Impact

This issue allows attackers to gain additional tokens by tricking users into submitting a bid to a rogue marketplace with apparent low fees, which will have its fee changed further on without notifying the user.

### PoC

_No response_

### Mitigation

Introduce a new field in the Bid structure that stores the marketplace fee at the time of bid submission. Then, lenderAcceptBid reads the value directly from the structure.
