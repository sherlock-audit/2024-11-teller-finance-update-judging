# Overpaying a loan can DoS an entire lender commitment group

### Summary

## Summary
Inserting larger amount in `repayLoan` allows to repay more than what was lent to user, disturbing the internal accounting of a lender group
## Description
Lender commitment groups use 2 variables to track how many tokens are currently being lent out - `totalPrincipalTokensLended` and `totalPrincipalTokensRepaid`. 
Effectively, the latter should always be smaller or equal than the former. Whenever the 2 variables are equal it means that there are currently no active loans which is used in `getTotalPrincipalTokensOutstandingInActiveLoans`
```solidity
    function getTotalPrincipalTokensOutstandingInActiveLoans()
        public
        view
        returns (uint256)
    {
        return totalPrincipalTokensLended - totalPrincipalTokensRepaid;
    }
```

This method can be forced to always revert if user repays at least 1 wei more than they were originally lent, causing an underflow during substraction.
The code currently allows for repaying more due to a logic error within `_repayLoan`
The method is passed a `Payment` struct which consists of 2 variables whose sum totals the `amount` borrower is willing to overpay (principal + interest)
```solidity
    function _repayLoan(
        uint256 _bidId,
    @>  Payment memory _payment,
        uint256 _owedAmount,
        bool _shouldWithdrawCollateral
    ) internal virtual {
        Bid storage bid = bids[_bidId];
@>      uint256 paymentAmount = _payment.principal + _payment.interest; // memory variable summing the 2 values

        RepMark mark = reputationManager.updateAccountReputation(
            bid.borrower,
            _bidId
        );
        // Check if we are sending a payment or amount remaining
        if (paymentAmount >= _owedAmount) {
@>           paymentAmount = _owedAmount;                               // memory variable is overwritten to match the owed amount

            if (bid.state != BidState.LIQUIDATED) {
                bid.state = BidState.PAID;
            }
         
            _borrowerBidsActive[bid.borrower].remove(_bidId);

       
            if (_shouldWithdrawCollateral) { 
               
                collateralManager.withdraw(_bidId);
            }

            emit LoanRepaid(_bidId);
        } else {
            emit LoanRepayment(_bidId);
        }
@>       _sendOrEscrowFunds(_bidId, _payment);  // @audit-issue unmodified payment struct is passed, memory variable paymentAmount not used anywhere
    }
    
```
The `paymentAmount >= _owedAmount` check is not performed correctly since `paymentAmount` is practically not used anywhere further down in the code. Unmodified `_payment` struct is passed in `_sendOrEscrowFunds` which triggers the [repayLoanCallback](https://github.com/sherlock-audit/2024-11-teller-finance-update/blob/0c8535728f97d37a4052d2a25909d28db886a422/teller-protocol-v2-audit-2024/packages/contracts/contracts/LenderCommitmentForwarder/extensions/LenderCommitmentGroup/LenderCommitmentGroup_Smart.sol#L928-L945) for the lender group incrementing `totalPrincipalTokensRepaid` by the amount in the `_payment` struct. 

Once `totalPrincipalTokensRepaid` is higher than `totalPrincipalTokensLended`, any attempts to issue loans will revert due to `getTotalPrincipalTokensOutstandingInActiveLoans` underflowing. Attack can be performed by backrunning commitment group creations and funding by taking a loan and repaying it immediately with an extra wei, bricking it forever since the underflowing function is used in `getMinInterestRate` which is called in `acceptFundsForAcceptBid`

[Similar finding](https://github.com/sherlock-audit/2024-04-teller-finance-judging/issues/32) was part of the previous audit contest yet it was not fixed. Risk of DoS is still very much present and fix is rather simple. Furthermore the README states an invariant that should hold:
>Very importantly, we expect the following invariant: the 'EstimatedTotalValue' of a LenderGroupPool should accurately track the value of principal tokens in a pool.

Even if a DoS is not performed, the value of principal tokens will not be tracked correctly since overpays will underestimate the free funds within the contract, lowering the utilization ratio too. 

### Root Cause

- `_repayLoan` does not indicate whether a payment is the last one for a loan
- `sendOrEscrowFunds` performs a sanity check incorrectly and uses unmodified payment struct 

### Internal pre-conditions

None

### External pre-conditions

None

### Attack Path

1. Lender commitment group is deployed and funded by owner
2. Adversary takes a loan for 100e6 USDC, immediately repays it through `repayLoan(bidId, 100e6+1) 
3. Lender commitment group can no longer issue loans since `acceptFundsForAcceptBid` relies on `getTotalPrincipalTokensOutstandingInActiveLoans` which now underflows due to `100e6 - (100e6+1) < 0` 

### Impact

DoS of entire group

### PoC

_No response_

### Mitigation

If user invokes `repayLoan` with `amount` exceeding his total dues, perform `repayLoanFull` instead.
