# Sudden drop/increase in share value allows users who monitor to gain at the expense of the others

### Summary

Sudden drop/increase in share value allows users who monitor to gain at the expense of the others

### Root Cause

The pools value is calculated as:

```solidity
    function getPoolTotalEstimatedValue()
        public
        view
        returns (uint256 poolTotalEstimatedValue_)
    {
       
         int256 poolTotalEstimatedValueSigned = int256(totalPrincipalTokensCommitted) 
         + int256(totalInterestCollected)  + int256(tokenDifferenceFromLiquidations) 
         - int256(totalPrincipalTokensWithdrawn);


        //if the poolTotalEstimatedValue_ is less than 0, we treat it as 0.  
```
There are multiple reasons why the pools share value can sharply increase/decrease:

1. The possible value of `tokenDifferenceFromLiquidations` for an auction ranges from (764% * amountDue , -amountDue) and is updated when the dutch auction for the collateral liquidation settles. This allows for a user to either front-run and deposit (in case the auction will be settling at a higher price) or prepare for a withdrawal and then withdraw their share at a higher price before the auction settles at a lower price inflicting the loss to the other shareholders. This also affects the new depositors since the `_minSharesAmountOut` won't be effective

2. Interest repayment: In case of a large interest repayment, users who monitor for this can front run this repayment and then queue a withdrawal. This way they won't be deposited into the pool but will still earn the interest

### Internal pre-conditions

_No response_

### External pre-conditions

_No response_

### Attack Path

1. User monitors a large repayment of interest
2. User front-runs this tx and deposits into the pool
3. User then queues withdrawal for their shares to take the profit

### Impact

Naive users can suffer unfair losses

### PoC

_No response_

### Mitigation

Implementing a depsoit queue could solve the share value increase issue
