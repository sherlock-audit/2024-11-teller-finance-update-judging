# MarketPlace Owner can change fee after the bid is already submited

### Summary

The way it currently works [`amountToMarketplace`](https://github.com/sherlock-audit/2024-11-teller-finance-update/blob/0c8535728f97d37a4052d2a25909d28db886a422/teller-protocol-v2-audit-2024/packages/contracts/contracts/TellerV2.sol#L517C1-L517C17) is calculated in [`lenderAcceptBid()` ](https://github.com/sherlock-audit/2024-11-teller-finance-update/blob/0c8535728f97d37a4052d2a25909d28db886a422/teller-protocol-v2-audit-2024/packages/contracts/contracts/TellerV2.sol#L473) based on the current market fee which can be changed by the marketplace owner between the time a user submits a bid and the time the lender accepts it, resulting in loss of funds for the user that submitted the bid.

### Root Cause

In [`TellerV2.sol:517`](https://github.com/sherlock-audit/2024-11-teller-finance-update/blob/0c8535728f97d37a4052d2a25909d28db886a422/teller-protocol-v2-audit-2024/packages/contracts/contracts/TellerV2.sol#L517) the `amountToMarketplace` is calculated using the current market fee which can be changed at any time by the market owner and it allows a market owner using `updateMarketSettings()` in [`MarketRegistry.sol:503`](https://github.com/sherlock-audit/2024-11-teller-finance-update/blob/0c8535728f97d37a4052d2a25909d28db886a422/teller-protocol-v2-audit-2024/packages/contracts/contracts/MarketRegistry.sol#L503C14-L503C34) to trick the user into thinking the fee is very low and then change it after the bid is placed, if the market owner is also a lender it can increase the fee and accept the bid in the same transaction leaving the user without any chance of canceling the bid after the fee increase. The market owner can just as well have a secondary wallet or a deployed contract that is a lender and use that to hide his malicious intentions.

### Attack Path

1. User finds a market with a low fee to bid on
2. Marketplace owner changes the fee to max fee amount using [`updateMarketSettings()`](https://github.com/sherlock-audit/2024-11-teller-finance-update/blob/0c8535728f97d37a4052d2a25909d28db886a422/teller-protocol-v2-audit-2024/packages/contracts/contracts/MarketRegistry.sol#L503C14-L503C34)
3. Lender accepts the bid using [`lenderAcceptBid()`](https://github.com/sherlock-audit/2024-11-teller-finance-update/blob/0c8535728f97d37a4052d2a25909d28db886a422/teller-protocol-v2-audit-2024/packages/contracts/contracts/TellerV2.sol#L473)

### Impact

Users can lose funds (up to max market fee of 10%) to the market because the market fee can be modified before the lender accepts it

### PoC

_No response_

### Mitigation

The market fee can be placed inside the bid structure and set once the user uses [`submitBid()`](https://github.com/sherlock-audit/2024-11-teller-finance-update/blob/0c8535728f97d37a4052d2a25909d28db886a422/teller-protocol-v2-audit-2024/packages/contracts/contracts/TellerV2.sol#L275) as to not allow the market owner to change it after the user submitted the bid

Other less practical mitigation: set up a time delay between when the market owner can update the market settings
