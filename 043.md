# Using original principal amount as due amount inside `liquidateDefaultedLoanWithIncentive` breaks contract accounting leading to lost assets/broken functionalities

### Summary

Using original principal amount as due amount inside `liquidateDefaultedLoanWithIncentive` breaks contract accounting leading to lost assets/broken functionalities

### Root Cause

In `liquidateDefaultedLoanWithIncentive`, the amount due is taken as the [original principal amount](https://github.com/sherlock-audit/2024-11-teller-finance-update/blob/0c8535728f97d37a4052d2a25909d28db886a422/teller-protocol-v2-audit-2024/packages/contracts/contracts/LenderCommitmentForwarder/extensions/LenderCommitmentGroup/LenderCommitmentGroup_Smart.sol#L657-L664) of the bid rather than the remaining to be repaid principal which is incorrect as part of this principal could [have already been paid back](https://github.com/sherlock-audit/2024-11-teller-finance-update/blob/0c8535728f97d37a4052d2a25909d28db886a422/teller-protocol-v2-audit-2024/packages/contracts/contracts/LenderCommitmentForwarder/extensions/LenderCommitmentGroup/LenderCommitmentGroup_Smart.sol#L928-L935)

```solidity
    function liquidateDefaultedLoanWithIncentive(
        uint256 _bidId,
        int256 _tokenAmountDifference
    ) external whenForwarderNotPaused whenNotPaused bidIsActiveForGroup(_bidId) nonReentrant onlyOracleApprovedAllowEOA {
        
        //use original principal amount as amountDue

        uint256 amountDue = _getAmountOwedForBid(_bidId);
```

```solidity
    function _getAmountOwedForBid(uint256 _bidId )
        internal
        view
        virtual
        returns (uint256 amountDue)
    {
        // @audit this is the entire principal amount which is incorrect
        (,,,, amountDue, , ,  )
         = ITellerV2(TELLER_V2).getLoanSummary(_bidId);  
    }
```

Parts of the original principal could have been repaid and accounted via this function leading to double counting of principal in `totalPrincipalTokensRepaid`
```solidity
    function repayLoanCallback(
        uint256 _bidId,
        address repayer,
        uint256 principalAmount,
        uint256 interestAmount
    ) external onlyTellerV2 whenForwarderNotPaused whenNotPaused bidIsActiveForGroup(_bidId) { 
        totalPrincipalTokensRepaid += principalAmount;
        totalInterestCollected += interestAmount;
```

This leads to several problems:
1. Underflow in `totalPrincipalTokensLended - totalPrincipalTokensRepaid` as `totalPrincipalTokensRepaid` can double count repaid tokens causing bids to revert  
2. Lost assets due to `tokenDifferenceFromLiquidations` calculating difference from `totalPrincipal` without considering the repaid assets

### Internal pre-conditions

_No response_

### External pre-conditions

_No response_

### Attack Path

1. A loan is created with principal amount == 100
tokenBalanceOfContract == 0

totalPrincipalTokensCommitted == 100
totalPrincipalTokensWithdrawn == 0
totalPrincipalTokensLended == 100
totalPrincipalTokensRepaid == 0
tokenDifferenceFromLiquidations == 0

2. Repayment of 80 principal occurs before the loan gets defaulted
tokenBalanceOfContract == 80

totalPrincipalTokensCommitted == 100
totalPrincipalTokensWithdrawn == 0
totalPrincipalTokensLended == 100
totalPrincipalTokensRepaid == 80
tokenDifferenceFromLiquidations == 0

3. Loan defaults and auction settles at price 50 (similarly problematic paths are lenders withdrawing 80 first or the auction settling at higher prices)
tokenBalanceOfContract == 80 + 50 == 130

totalPrincipalTokensCommitted == 100
totalPrincipalTokensWithdrawn == 0
totalPrincipalTokensLended == 100
totalPrincipalTokensRepaid == 80 + 100 == 180 => incorrect
tokenDifferenceFromLiquidations == (100 - 50 == -50) => incorrect

Now: 
- available amount to withdraw will be calculated as (totalPrincipalTokensCommitted + tokenDifferenceFromLiquidations == 50) while there is actually 130 amount of assets available to withdraw causing loss for lenders
- getPrincipalAmountAvailableToBorrow will underflow because (totalPrincipalTokensLended - totalPrincipalTokensRepaid == -80) and no new bids can be accepted

There are more scenarios that arise from the same root cause such as estimated value becoming 0 incorrectly, which will cause division by 0 and hence revert on withdrawals, deposits will be lost or 0 shares will be minted etc. 

### Impact

Lost assets for users, broken functionalities

_No response_

### Mitigation

Instead of the totalPrincipal consider the remaining principal ie. `totalPrincipal - repaidPrincipal`
