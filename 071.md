# EMI calculation is flawed

### Summary

Taking min when calculating EMI repayment amount is flawed

### Root Cause

The amount due in case of EMI repayment is calculated as:
https://github.com/sherlock-audit/2024-11-teller-finance-update/blob/0c8535728f97d37a4052d2a25909d28db886a422/teller-protocol-v2-audit-2024/packages/contracts/contracts/libraries/V2Calculations.sol#L124-L138
```solidity
        } else {
            // Default to PaymentType.EMI
            // Max payable amount in a cycle
            // NOTE: the last cycle could have less than the calculated payment amount


            //the amount owed for the cycle should never exceed the current payment cycle amount  so we use min here 
            uint256 owedAmountForCycle = Math.min(  ((_bid.terms.paymentCycleAmount  * owedTime)  ) /
                    _paymentCycleDuration , _bid.terms.paymentCycleAmount+interest_ ) ;


            uint256 owedAmount = isLastPaymentCycle
                ? owedPrincipal_ + interest_
                : owedAmountForCycle  ;


            duePrincipal_ = Math.min(owedAmount - interest_, owedPrincipal_);
        }
```

This is incorrect and leads to lowered payments since `_bid.terms.paymentCycleAmount+interest_` will be taken instead of the ratio wise amount

Eg:
Principal (P) = 100
Annual Rate (r) = 12% = 0.12
Number of Monthly Payments (n) = 12
monthly EMI = 8.84

But if the repayment occurs after 2 months, this formula calculates the amount due as 8.84 + 2 == 10.84 instead of 8.84 * 2

Incorrectly lowered payments in case of EMI repayments

### Mitigation

Dont take the min. Instead use 
```solidity
 ((_bid.terms.paymentCycleAmount  * owedTime)  ) /
                    _paymentCycleDuration
```
